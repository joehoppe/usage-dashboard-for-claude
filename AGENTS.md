# Overview

## Architecture

Use an **onion architecture**. Dependencies point inward only — an inner layer
must never import from an outer one.

```text
        UI / drivers (wxPython frame, panels, PollerThread)
      ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
      │   Infrastructure / adapters                       │
      │  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
      │  │   Application (use cases)                   │  │
      │  │  ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐  │  │
      │  │  │   Domain (entities + pure logic)      │  │  │
      │  │  └───────────────────────────────────────┘  │  │
      │  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
      └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Domain** — entities and pure business rules: `Snapshot`, usage/quota value
  objects, model-ID normalization, cost computation, rolling-window math. No
  I/O, no `wx`, no filesystem, no third-party SDKs. Standard library only.
- **Application** — use cases that orchestrate the domain: aggregation, refresh
  cycles, staleness rules. Depends on the domain and on **ports** (abstract
  interfaces it declares itself, e.g. `TranscriptSource`, `QuotaSource`,
  `PricingSource`). Never depends on a concrete reader.
- **Infrastructure** — adapters that implement those ports: JSONL transcript
  tailing, `~/.claude.json` reads, pricing tables, config, clock. This is the
  only layer allowed to touch the filesystem or parse external formats.
- **UI / drivers** — wxPython frame and panels, `PollerThread`, entrypoint
  wiring. Composes concrete adapters and injects them into the application
  layer at startup (composition root). Widgets render a `Snapshot`; they do not
  compute one.

Rules:

- Inward-only imports. If an inner layer needs an outer capability, define a
  port and inject the implementation.
- Cross layers with immutable, plain data (frozen dataclasses), not with live
  file handles or `wx` objects.
- The domain and application layers must be unit-testable with no filesystem,
  no GUI, and no sleeping — use fakes for ports rather than temp dirs or real
  transcripts where practical.
- Keep the layer boundaries visible in the package layout (e.g. `domain/`,
  `application/`, `infrastructure/`, `ui/`) so a violating import is obvious in
  review.

## Licensing

This should only implement packages using the following licenses:

- MIT
- Apache-2.0

If you want to propose using a package that is not listed above, ask for explicit approval before proceeding

### Approved exceptions

- **wxPython** — approved 2026-08-05. Licensed under the wxWindows Library
  Licence (LGPL v2 plus an exception permitting binary object code versions of
  derived works to be distributed under your own terms). OSI-approved and
  GPL-compatible. This project's own source may stay MIT; the copyleft reaches
  only wxWidgets/wxPython source files. Installing via `pip` redistributes
  nothing, so no obligations trigger. If a frozen binary is ever shipped
  (PyInstaller/py2app), include the wxWindows licence text as attribution. The
  one real obligation: modifications to wxWidgets/wxPython source itself, if
  distributed, must ship their source. Do not prompt again for wxPython.

## Linting

ruff is both the linter and the formatter. Install it with the `dev` extra
and run both halves before proposing a change:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .          # add --fix to apply the safe fixes
ruff format .
```

CI runs the same two commands (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`), with
`ruff format --diff` in place of the rewrite, so unformatted code fails the
build rather than landing.

Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`. Two notes on it:

- The version is pinned exactly, and CI greps that pin out of the file. It
  is the only copy — do not add a second one to the workflow.
- `sample/` is excluded. It is a standalone illustration of the architecture
  that nothing imports and nothing packages.

Reach for a `# noqa` only when the rule is wrong about a specific line, and
say why on the same line. If a rule is wrong about the codebase as a whole,
it belongs in `ignore` or `per-file-ignores` with a comment, not scattered
across the files it misjudges.

## Docstrings

Every module gets a one-line docstring saying what it is for. ruff enforces
this (`D100`); test modules are exempt, since their file name already names
the module under test.

Give a class a docstring when its role isn't obvious from its name and
signature, which means always for:

- application services and use cases: who calls them, what they
  orchestrate, and any state they keep between calls
- infrastructure adapters: which port they implement and what external
  format or location they read
- UI drivers and composition roots: what they wire together

Frozen dataclasses, enums and `Protocol` ports can skip it when the
field and method names say everything. Explain non-obvious fields or
members with a trailing comment instead.

Write about behavior and intent: why it exists, what it guarantees,
what it does on failure. Don't restate the signature.

## Spec Documents

Markdown spec documents should be saved in the folder in which it will likely be implemented, and committed alongside the code.
When and if the feature itself is removed, the spec should also be removed.
